# File Operations

Files are a core component of computing, and knowing how to work with them 
using Go is essential for efficient programming. This guide covers basic file 
operations, such as opening, closing, creating, and deleting files. It also 
includes renaming, moving files, checking for file existence, and modifying 
file permissions, ownership, timestamps, and symbolic links.

Most of the examples in this guide use a hardcoded filename, `test.txt`. You 
can easily modify this filename to work with different files as needed.
