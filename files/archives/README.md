# Working with Archives

Archives are file formats used to store multiple files in a single package. 
Two common archive formats are TAR and ZIP. The Go standard library includes 
support for both formats through the `tar` and `zip` packages.

This guide uses the ZIP format for examples, but switching to the TAR format 
is straightforward and can be done with minimal changes.
